## Description

Makes some balance adjustments to Krastorio 2's fuel changes.

* Restores vanilla acceleration and top speed multipliers for rocket fuel and nuclear fuel.
* Fixes that nuclear locomotives used the wrong fuel category. Krastorio 2 makes them use nuclear fuel cells, but they're supposed to use nuclear fuel.
